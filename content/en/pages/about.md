Hi there! I'm Daniel and my IT escapade began in 2022 on the helpdesk. With a degree in Journalism to my name, my IT know-how was pretty basic. My Uni experience wasn't really assisting with me with configure any routers. However, a neat little project where I set up a Plex server on an old laptop really kick-started my learning. It's projects like these, which I think are fantastic ways to learn, are what I plan to post on this blog.

Moreover, this blog isn't really about my journey; Iâ€™d like to use it to show you that it's perfectly fine to start from scratch. Getting into IT in my mid to late 20â€™s was daunting but a rewarding experience so Iâ€™d like to share that with others.

Feel free to have a read and reach out on Linkedin if youâ€™d like to chat or have any questions ðŸ™‚
