# About 

Hi there! I'm Daniel. My IT adventure began in 2022 on the helpdesk. With a degree in Journalism to my name, my IT know-how was pretty basic â€“ It definitely didnâ€™t help me learn  how to configure MDM policies at Uni. However, a neat little project, where I set up a Plex server on an old computer, really kick-started my learning. It's projects like these, which Iâ€™d like to start posting on this blog, that I find the best way to learn.

Moreover, this blog isn't really about my journey; Iâ€™d like to use it to show you that it's perfectly fine to start from scratch. Getting into IT in my mid to late 20â€™s was daunting but a rewarding experience so Iâ€™d like to share that with others.

Feel free to have a read and reach out on Linkedin if youâ€™d like to chat or have any questions ðŸ™‚
